## What's better for your miles per galon (mpg): an automatic or a manual car? 
### Summary

This week we will investigate how cars characteristcs impact how many gallons per miles are used. For that research we are going to use the `mtcars` dataset. 

#### Data Processing

Before we read our data, we are going to load the required libraries and set the global options for the data analysis and regression modeling.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(reshape2)
```

```{r setup}
opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center")
options(scipen = 1, digits = 2)
```

Lets look for our data 
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- plot(cars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(x)
```
